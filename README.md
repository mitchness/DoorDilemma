# DoorDilemma
Screenplay for a "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode

## SCENE 1 – EXT. DENTIST BUILDING – MORNING

  LARRY DAVID walks briskly toward a medical building, slightly late. He reaches for the door, opens it... then pauses.
  
  Far down the path, a SLOW OLD MAN (80s) is approaching. Larry hesitates. Moral gears turn.
  
  He sighs and holds the door.


                LARRY (muttering)
        This guy’s moving like he’s underwater.

The man finally reaches the door.

                OLD MAN
        Thank you.

  
He shuffles inside. Larry is stuck behind him, crawling pace. They reach the elevators—doors closing.
  
                LARRY
         Hey! Can you—!
  
Too late. The elevator is gone.
  
                LARRY (under his breath)
         Unbelievable.


## SCENE 2 – INT. DENTIST OFFICE – MOMENTS LATER
LARRY bursts in. The RECEPTIONIST, chipper but fake, looks up.

                RECEPTIONIST
         Oh—Mr. David. We gave your slot away. You were ten minutes late.  So...

                LARRY
         Ten minutes?! That’s nothing! Ten minutes is not late, that’s... human.

                RECEPTIONIST
         You're in luck.  We had a cancellation. But that's not until an hour.

                LARRY (gesturing behind him)
         I got stuck behind a human speed bump. Ever try walking behind molasses with arthritis? That’s what I did!

                DENTIST (O.S.)
         We’ll do the cleaning today. Come back next week for the fillings—we’re behind.

                LARRY (sarcastic)
         Perfect. Two appointments. Love that. Super efficient.

## SCENE 3 – EXT. PARKING LOT – LATER
LARRY walks toward his car, checks his watch—he’s missed lunch. Then spots a METER MAID writing a ticket.

                LARRY
         Hey hey hey! I’m here! You see me coming!

                METER MAID
         Expired twenty minutes ago.

                LARRY
         Twenty?! That’s Slow-Mo back there! He’s costing me money now!

## SCENE 4 – INT. DENTIST OFFICE – NEXT WEEK
LARRY returns. A new day.

He reaches for the door—sees a WOMAN (40s) approaching in the distance. A real distance. Football field far.

He eyes her... then shrugs and lets the door go. It closes behind him.

Seconds later: THUD... gasp.

## SCENE 5 – INT. DENTIST WAITING ROOM – MINUTES LATER
LARRY sits with a magazine. The WOMAN enters, holding her shoulder.

                WOMAN
         Ow... oh man...

RECEPTIONIST rushes over. The DENTIST peeks out.

                RECEPTIONIST
         Oh my god, what happened?

                WOMAN
         The door closed on me. I hurt my shoulder. Some guy didn’t hold it open.

(All heads turn to Larry.)

                LARRY
         What?! No! That door was basically closed already. She was so far away.

                DENTIST
         Larry...

                RECEPTIONIST
         You couldn’t have held it five more seconds?

                LARRY
         Five seconds? You’re assuming she walks like a sprinter! What if I stand there five, then ten—then we’re back to Slow-Mo from last week!

                WOMAN
         I’m gonna need physical therapy now!

## SCENE 6 – INT. AGENT’S HOUSE – NIGHT
LARRY tells the story to his AGENT (TED).

                TED
         You did the right thing. She was far. There's a door distance limit. Everyone knows that.

                LARRY
         Thank you! I’m not the Door Doorman! It’s not a hotel!

TED’S WIFE enters.

                WIFE
         Who are you talking about?

                TED
         Some lady who hurt her shoulder.

                WIFE
         Wait... Sandra? Sandra with the Pilates place?

                LARRY
         She does Pilates? That shoulder didn’t look flexible to me.

                WIFE
         She’s my friend, Larry!

                LARRY
         I've never heard you mention her.

                WIFE
         Shut up.  Anyways, she said some guy “aggressively didn’t hold the door.” Now she had to see a chiropractor!

                LARRY
         "Aggressively didn’t hold the door"?! That’s not even a thing!

## SCENE 7 – INT. COFFEE SHOP – NEXT DAY
LARRY and TED enter. Larry opens the door for Ted.

                 TED
         Wow. What a gentleman.

                 LARRY
         I’ve matured. I’m a new man. A door saint.

Then — a MAN (30s) way down the block sees Larry holding the door... and starts jogging.

                LARRY (sighs)
         Here we go...

The man speeds up—then TRIPS HARD. Falls. Screams.

                MAN
         Ahhh! My ankle! Why would you hold the door that long!?

                LARRY
         I was being nice! I can’t win!

                MAN
         You pressured me! I had to run! It’s door guilt!  You gave me door guilt.

                LARRY
         What do you mean door-guilt.

                MAN
         Massive door guilt.
         

Guess who’s also in the shop? The DENTIST and RECEPTIONIST enjoying some coffee.

                DENTIST
          Larry?!

                RECEPTIONIST
          Are you... are you injuring more people now?

                LARRY
          I’m not the Door Dictator! Okay? I’m just trying to get a cup of coffee without becoming a door villain!

                TED
          Door-tator.

                LARRY
          Exactly. No one wants that.
