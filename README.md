# DoorDilemma
Screenplay for a "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode

## SCENE 1 – EXT. DENTIST BUILDING – MORNING

  LARRY DAVID walks briskly toward a medical building, slightly late. He reaches for the door, opens it... then pauses.
  
  Far down the path, a SLOW OLD MAN (80s) is approaching. Larry hesitates. Moral gears turn.
  
  He sighs and holds the door.


                LARRY (muttering)
        This guy’s moving like he’s underwater.

The man finally reaches the door.

                OLD MAN
        Thank you.

  
He shuffles inside. Larry is stuck behind him, crawling pace. They reach the elevators—doors closing.
  
                LARRY
         Hey! Can you hold the door—!
  
Too late. The elevator is gone.
  
                LARRY (under his breath)
         Unbelievable.


## SCENE 2 – INT. DENTIST OFFICE – MOMENTS LATER
LARRY bursts in. The RECEPTIONIST, chipper but fake, looks up.

                RECEPTIONIST
         Oh—Mr. David. We gave your slot away. You were ten minutes late.  So...

                LARRY
         Ten minutes?! That’s nothing! Ten minutes is not late, that’s... human.

                RECEPTIONIST
         You are in luck, though.  We had a cancellation. But that's not until an hour.

                LARRY (gesturing behind him)
         I got stuck behind a human speed bump. Ever try walking behind molasses with arthritis? That’s what I did!

                DENTIST (O.S.)
         We’ll do the cleaning today. Come back next week for the fillings—we’re behind.

                LARRY (sarcastic)
         Perfect. Two appointments. Love that. Super efficient.

## SCENE 3 – EXT. PARKING LOT – LATER
LARRY walks toward his car, checks his watch—he’s missed lunch. Then spots a METER MAID writing a ticket.

                LARRY
         Hey hey hey! I’m here! You see me coming!

                METER MAID
         Expired twenty minutes ago.

                LARRY
         Twenty?! That’s Slow-Mo back there! He’s costing me money now!

## SCENE 4 – INT. DENTIST OFFICE – NEXT WEEK
LARRY returns. A new day.

He reaches for the door—sees a WOMAN (40s) approaching in the distance. A real distance. Football field far.

He eyes her... then shrugs and lets the door go. It closes behind him.

Seconds later: THUD... gasp.

## SCENE 5 – INT. DENTIST WAITING ROOM – MINUTES LATER
LARRY is sitting with his phone. The WOMAN enters, holding her shoulder.

                WOMAN
         Ow... oh man...

RECEPTIONIST rushes over. The DENTIST peeks out.

                  RECEPTIONIST
         Oh my god, what happened?

                  WOMAN
         The door closed on me. I think I messed up my shoulder. 
         Some guy, he saw me coming but couldn't be bothered to hold the door open for me.
         This short, wiry guy... kinda hunched. Like a neurotic meerkat.

Larry quickly picks up a magazine and tries to hide his face.  He looks quizidly.  
Turns it around to look at the magazine cover.  It says "Womens World".  The main article is titled “10 Foods That Will Ruin Your Gums.”
That's when everyone notices him.

                  LARRY
         Alright, alright — “neurotic meerkat”? That’s a little personal, don’t you think?

                  WOMAN (notices him)
         You?!

                  LARRY
         Yes, me. But in my defense — and I say this with all due respect —
         you were a speck on the horizon. A silhouette. Maybe a mirage!

                  DENTIST
         Larry...

                  LARRY
         Look, I’ve got a system, okay? - a door timing algorithm. You account for distance, 
         walking speed, athleticism, wind resistance—

                   RECEPTIONIST
         Wind resistance?

                  LARRY
         Yes, if she’s carrying a tote bag or fighting a headwind, you shave off seconds.
         It’s all math.

                  WOMAN
         You calculated whether or not to hold the door?

                  LARRY
         I didn't use a calculator — there was instinctual math happening. 
         It’s a real-time ethical math equation!
         
                  RECEPTIONIST
         And the solution was “let the door crush her”?

                  LARRY
         No, look. If the door closes... naturally... by the time she gets to the door
         — well then I’m in the clear.
         But the door was one of those slow-shutters.

                DENTIST
         Larry...

                  LARRY
         She was so far away.

                RECEPTIONIST
         You couldn’t have held it five more seconds?

                LARRY
         Five seconds? You’re assuming she walks like a sprinter!
         What if I wait five, then ten?
         Then we’re back to Slow-Mo from last week!
         
                WOMAN
         Well now I need physical therapy — thanks to your little algorithm.


## SCENE 6 – INT. AGENT’S HOUSE – NIGHT
LARRY tells the story to his AGENT (JEFF).

                JEFF
         You did the right thing. She was far. There's a door distance limit. Everyone knows that.

                LARRY
         Exactly!  Thank you!  If that door shuts by the time she gets there.  
         That's it.  That's fair. 
         I’m not some bellhop with door duties. If she’s not there in time, game over. Door’s closed.
         
                JEFF
         Like you were never even part of the equation.

                LARRY
         But you know..., the door was one of those slow-shutters — you know the kind.

                JEFF
         The fake-out slow ones?
         Well that makes it hard to gauge.

                LARRY
         It sure does.  And to top it off, it was one of those doors that has the last second slams.
         Teases you like it’s staying open... then snaps shut like a bear trap.
         
                JEFF
         Those are the worst.  Totally unpredictable.  Mechanical treachery.


JEFF’S WIFE enters.

                SUSIE
         Who are you talking about?

                JEFF
         Some lady who hurt her shoulder.

                SUSIE
         Wait... Sandra? Sandra with the Pilates place?

                LARRY
         She does Pilates? That shoulder didn’t look flexible to me.

                SUSIE
         She’s my friend, Larry!

                LARRY
         I've never heard you mention her.

                SUSIE
         Shut up.  Anyways, she said some guy “aggressively didn’t hold the door.” 
         Now she had to see a chiropractor!

                LARRY
         "Aggressively didn’t hold the door"?! That’s not even a thing!

## SCENE 7 – Door Montage

 * Scene 1. There is a set of double doors.  Larry opens the first door for a stranger.  Stranger enters.
            Larry quickly juts ahead to open the second door.  He slightly pushes the stranger as he opens
            the 2nd door.  Stranger looks at him with an uncomfortable smile and enters the second door.  
            Just as Larry catches his breath, he notices a 3rd door.


 * Scene 2. Larry is in a parking car garage elevetor.  As the elevetor door opens, he lets a lady leave first.
            This leads to a door.  The lady opens the rather heavy door.  Larry quickly rushes to help her open the door, akwardly.
            This allows the lady to enter the door first.  Larry follows.  As she walks to her car, Larry is right behind her
            (Their cars are parked together).  The further they walk, the more she starts to get nervous.  Larry is whistling a 
            happy tune, un-awares.  She makes a sharp right and quickly enters her car.  Larry looks on.  As she enters, Larry
            stands there, watching.  They are parked together.  Larry has parked backend-first so their doors driver side doors abut.  At this point
            Larry starts to get impatient, while the lady is at a mild panic.  She quickly backs up so Larry has to wait.
            As she reverses, they watch each other through the window.  Larry, blissfully happy.  Her, close to tears.

         
 * Scene 3. Larry open the door for a nice, pleasant Girl Scout.  Soon another arrives around the corner, then another.  Soon, he 
            is holding the door open for the entire troup.  This the troop leader and his strapping husband follow in the rear.  Larry
            tries to continue to open the door for the two of them.  The strapping man will not allow it.  Larry tries to insist.  To
            no avail.  He gives in.  The strapping man looks even more strapping as he holds the door open.  Soon another troop follows
            behind.  Larry is sandwiched between two troops of girl scouts.  Looking sheepish.


 * Scene 4. Larry enters a revolving door.  A pair of kids are in there.  Playing, having fun.  The make the door stop suddenly.  Laughing
            Larry almost falls.  More of this.  As the kids start laughing harder and harder.  Larry has a harder and harder time.
         



## SCENE 8 – EXT. HOTEL LOBBY ENTRANCE – DAY
LARRY, JEFF, and SUSIE are walking up to a fancy hotel. A sleek AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR whooshes open as they approach.

LARRY rushes a few steps ahead and stretches out his arms dramatically—like he's holding the doors open himself.

                LARRY (after a beat)
         There you go. Look at that. Door courtesy.

                SUSIE (laughing, then dead serious)
         Are you outta your mind? You didn’t open that door! It opened itself!

                LARRY
         Yeah, but I held it. I made the gesture. It’s the gesture that counts!

                SUSIE
         There’s no holding! There's no gesture.  It’s an automatic door, you jackass!
         You're pretending to hold light and motion sensors!

                JEFF
         Larry... she’s kinda right.

                LARRY
         Of course you’re taking her side. But it’s symbolic. It’s body language. 
         I’m saying, “Hey, I care. Go ahead.” That’s what society runs on—symbolic doors.

                  SUSIE
         You want a trophy for pretending to hold a door that opens itself?
         What’s next, you gonna salute the elevator?

                  LARRY
         It’s called consideration. I’m projecting politeness!

                  SUSIE
         You’re projecting something, all right.

                  JEFF
         You're play-acting courtesy for a robot, Larry.

                  LARRY
         It’s a gesture! The world needs gestures! What are we without gestures?

                  SUSIE
         Human beings with common sense.

                  LARRY
         No. We’re animals. Doorless animals.

                LARRY (pouting)
         Wow. Door respect is dead.


## SCENE 9 – INT. COFFEE SHOP – NEXT DAY
LARRY and JEFF enter. Larry opens the door for JEFF.

                 JEFF
         Wow. What a gentleman.

                 LARRY
         I’ve matured. I’m a new man. A door saint.

Then — a MAN (30s) way down the block sees Larry holding the door... and starts jogging.

                LARRY (sighs)
         Here we go...

The man speeds up—then TRIPS HARD. Falls. Screams.

                MAN
         Ahhh! My ankle! Why would you hold the door that long!?

                LARRY
         I was being nice! I can’t win!

                MAN
         You pressured me! I had to run! It’s door guilt!  You gave me door guilt.

                LARRY
         What do you mean door-guilt.

                MAN
         Massive door guilt.
         

Guess who’s also in the shop? The DENTIST and RECEPTIONIST enjoying some coffee.

                DENTIST
          Larry?!

                RECEPTIONIST
          Are you... are you injuring more people now?

                LARRY
          I’m not the Door Dictator! Okay? I’m just trying to get a cup of coffee without becoming a door villain!

                JEFF
          Door-tator.

                LARRY
          Exactly. No one wants that.
